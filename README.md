<h2>The shape</h2>
The mountains: There are three mountains I created base on the image, I can't really shape the correct shape in the image, but I do my best for build the correct shape. each mountains have the different type of shapes and when user is click the reroll button, the shape of the mountains will change random each time. I also create the boats and the wind for user to control, the boat have different shape such as the triangle and trapezoid and the wind have circle.

<h2>Randomness and user input</h2>
The color with more deep color show the mountain is the tallest and farest, which I set when user click on the reroll button and it will not have much mountain prominence. the closest mountain will be shortest and have many mountain prominence. Each time when press button reroll, the shape will be different random. Therefore, my shape for mountain will mostly like trangle. The user input is that user are allow to control the mouse the move left or right. To create a boat with sail, I will the trangle and trapezoid to create. The wind I use circle to create, but I use multiple circles and overlap the shape that like the wind. The wind and boat are the user input because the user are allow to control the mouse the move left or right(input that it reacts to). The logic is I set the domain x to the mouse x, so the wind and boat will move left or right when user control the mouse to move left or right. it is all base on user input.

<h2>Artist statement</h2>
In some way, I think my project did achieve my picture, for example, the ocean, the mountain and the boat have achieve that effect. However, In some way, I think it is not achieve that effect(I mean it is not perfect)because I didn't add too much datail, I just use the basic shape to simply draw the picture, which there are very poor details.
